# OASIS-LEVEL-1
Here I have completed the task given by the oasis infobyte as my internship work
Level 1 – TASK 1: Landing Page
What this code does:
This is a basic website homepage — a landing page that introduces a service or product. It includes a title, navigation links like Home/About/Contact, a big welcome message with a button, and a section showing three features (like Fast, Secure, Reliable). The footer just says the site's name and copyright.

What you learn from this:
You practice how to divide a webpage into sections, style them with CSS, align items nicely, and give your page a clean layout. It’s all about structure and design using just HTML and CSS.

Level 1 – TASK 2: Personal Portfolio
What this code does:
This is your personal portfolio website — the kind you can share with others to introduce yourself online. It starts with your picture and name at the top, followed by a short “About Me” section, a list of your skills (like HTML, CSS), a section showing your projects, and finally your contact info (email, phone, LinkedIn).

What you learn from this:
You get to show off your work while learning how to organize different sections. You also practice creating cards and responsive layouts. It helps you understand how to present yourself professionally using simple web code.

Level 1 – TASK 3: Temperature Converter Website
What this code does:
This is a small but smart tool! You type a temperature value (like 100), choose if it's in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin, and press a Convert button. The website will instantly show you the temperature in all other units.

What you learn from this:
You work with input fields, radio buttons, and JavaScript functions. It teaches you how to take user input, do some calculations, and show results back on the page — which is a basic but powerful web interaction concept.
